# Workthrough of Friedland's "Control System Design"
## Joe Dinius, Ph.D

## Intro
I have been wanting to gain a better understanding of state space methods for controller design, so I decided to work through Friedland's "Control System Design", available [here](https://www.amazon.com/Control-System-Design-Introduction-State-Space/dp/0486442780/ref=sr_1_1?crid=32JI0PCYH9KLS&keywords=friedland+control+system+design&qid=1553380369&s=gateway&sprefix=amazon+basics+7port+usb%2Caps%2C216&sr=8-1).  I have worked most of the problems from the book, ~90%, and I wanted to share it in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

## Setup
All notebooks have been verified to work within the conda environment defined by the `environment.yml` file in this repo.  It is _highly_ recommended that users use this same setup.

## Feedback (pun intended)
Sorry, I couldn't resist.  But, seriously:  suggestions for improvement and corrections are encouraged.
